Odin Project HTML lessons
6-12-25: Day 2; The Odin Project
This has been a great refresher on creating HTML. So far the Odin project has been fantastic, as it has built the foundations that I will need, as a developer, moving forward (github setup, posting etiquette, etc.,)
So far everything that I have learned has been delivered organically, meaning all the tasks and work, thusfar, has flowed naturally. The tasks have been reasonable and enough work is dished out in manageable portions--enough to keep you busy while exercising the mind. 

Today the Project that wrapped up the lessons was building a simple HTML site by hand that showcased recipes. Although most were pulled from the net, the CousCous recipe is my personal recipe--My daughter's favorite dish.
